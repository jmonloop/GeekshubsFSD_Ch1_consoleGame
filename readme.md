# FSD Video-console Proyect
This is the first proyect of GeeksHubs Academy FSD bootcamp.
The requirements are to design an electronic device (game-pad, portable console, etc) using HTML5 and CSS3.

Nintendo Switch design was chosen with some differences at the joysticks and buttons distribution so that in the future it can be re-used for playing in mobile devices.

Javascript functionalities were added so animations and the embedded game can be run.
